               distribution, contains info on how to use some of the stuff
               in lib/.

Nov 12 2002: * Fixed bug in foo-pre, which meant broken macro expansion.
             + Added log-message to make it easier parsing the logfile for pres.

               a shell-script or whatever for moving in case rename() fails.
